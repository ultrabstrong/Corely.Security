# Fails when a packable project changed since the last release tag without its <Version> changing.
#
# The failure this guards against is silent: `dotnet nuget push --skip-duplicate` treats an
# already-published version as success, so a forgotten bump publishes nothing and the release still
# reports success.
#
# Hard failure only when cutting a release (STRICT=1, set by the release workflow). On ordinary
# pushes it reports and exits 0 - a warning that fires on every comment edit is one people learn to
# ignore, and a version bump is only actually required at the point of publishing.
